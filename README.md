## Overview

Stealth Notes is useful for video meetings where you want to generally keep your mic enabled for talking, but still be able to take notes without annoying the other participants.

- Mutes your mic as quickly as possible after your first keystroke
- Waits a configurable interval after you stop typing before it unmutes the mic again
- Lets you configure which inputs to mute when typing
- Attempts to gracefully handle changes in available inputs, e.g., when a USB device is disconnected
